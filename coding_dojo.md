# Coding Dojo

From codingdojo.org: "A Coding Dojo is a meeting where a bunch of coders get together to work on a programming challenge. They are there have fun and to engage in deliberate practice in order to improve their skills."

## Format

* Decide on topic for session, choose a Kata (10 minutes)
* Code (40 minutes)
* Break to discuss how things are going (10 minutes)
* More code (40 minutes)

## Code

We work on a [Kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)) in the form of a [Randori Kata](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?RandoriKata) in a group.

Two people work on the code, one is the driver, the other is the navigator. We project their screen, so all others can watch and make suggestions.

After five to seven minutes the pair changes, the driver goes back to the audience, the navigator becomes the driver, and someone from the audience becomes the navigator.

We do small steps using Test Driven Development.

## The first rule

At the Dojo one cannot discuss a form without code, and one cannot show code without tests. It is a design training place, where it is acknowledged that "the code is the design" and that code without tests simply doesn't exist.
