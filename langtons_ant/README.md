# Langton's Ant

## Task

Implement Langton's Ant, a two-dimensional turing machine where an "ant" walks on a grid with black and white cells (they all start white) following two simple rules:

1. At a white square, turn 90° right, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit
2. At a black square, turn 90° left, flip the color of the square, move forward one unit

## Example

See the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton's_ant) for an animation of the ant's movements.
