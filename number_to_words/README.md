# Convert numbers to words

## Task

Write a method which converts a number given as an integer to a string
representing the same number but written in words.

## Examples

1 -> "one"
2 -> "two"
22 -> "twenty two"
999 -> "nine hundred ninety nine"

## Approach

Use test driven development and follow the TDD mantra (green, red, refactor). Do
very small steps, only do one change at once, and always write the test first.
