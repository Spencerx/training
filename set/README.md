# Set Kata

A set is an unordered collection of objects, where each object can only be
contained once. Two sets are equal, when they contain the same elements.

Implement a minimal API:

* add: add element
* remove: remove element
* empty?: returns if set is empty
* size: number of elements in set
* contains?: check if element is contained in set
* equals?: check if set is equal to another set

Additional API could be:

* Iterate through elements in a set
* Convert set to an array
* Initialize set with given elements
